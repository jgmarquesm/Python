<h2> This app checks if the input number is a prime number. If it is not prime, it will find all the divisors of the number and, if you want, show a list of all of them. Look the example below:</h2>

<h3>Here we wanted to know if 790 is a Prime number or not.</h3>

<h3>Because it isn't a Prime number we can see all the divisors of 790 if we want to.</h3>

<img src="https://github.com/jgmarquesm/Python/blob/main/All-divisors-of-a-number/img/example2.png" alt="790 is not a number. Asking if you want to see the list wilth all of the divisors of 790.">

<h3>Here we wanted to konw if 1997 is a Prime number or not... And it is!</h3>

<h3>If we enter a invalid data, it will appear a warning. Look at that:</h3>

<h4>To finish the application, we just enter stop as input.</h4>
