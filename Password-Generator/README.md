<h1>UPDATED</h1>
<h2>That's my first GUI Application.</h2>
<p>To code the backend I used some libraries: random, string, datetime, <a href="https://github.com/dwolfhub/zxcvbn">zxcvbn</a>, <a href="https://pyperclip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pyperclip</a> and os.</p>

<p>To frontend development I used <a href="https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PySimpleGUI</a> module.</p>

<h2>This app generates random passwords on demand for the user.</h2>

<p>First of all, you need to enter your password length and then just click on the type of password you want.</p>

<p>So, here you can choose if you want to chage the output file name.</p>

<p>Suppose that in the previous screen, you had chosen change it, so here you need to type the new file name.</p>

<p>The application will generate a password which will be saved in a .txt file, but will notify you on the screen below.</p>

<p>If you look at the previous screen, you figure out that you can copy the password to clipboard and paste it anywhere you want to... AND YOU CAN DO IT!</p>

<p>You may think "What about Exceptions?", and in the image below is the answer. If occur some error or exception, this window will raise.</p>

<h3>Below we see how the files were saved. You can verify these files <a href="https://github.com/jgmarquesm/Python/blob/main/Password-Generator/output">here</a>.</h3>

<h3 style="color: red">I need to update the code to run on Windows. I also want to make a executable from this application.</h3>
