Imagine that you only want to create a numeric password with 4 characters...</h3>

<h3>Note above, that you can choose the a personalized name to the output file, if you do not want to a customized name, it will be saved with a standart name that depends the date and time. Here I use the name "Test" to examplify. As you see, you can excute again or close it. Now, imagine you want to create 1 alphanumeric password without requirement, one with 8 characters:</h3>

<h3>This time we do not wanto change te output file. Now imagine that you want to create 1 alphanumeric password with requirement (at least 4 characters: 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number and 1 special character). So if you enter 3 or less as the character number, a warning will appear and you will have to enter another length for the password.</h3>
