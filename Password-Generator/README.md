<h3>Now imagine that you want to create an alphanumeric password with requirement (at least 4 characters: 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 number and 1 special character). So if you enter 3 as the character number, a warning will appear and you will have to enter another length for the password.</h3>
